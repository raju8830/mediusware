							<p>Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new class of Web Application that provide native app experiences using a browser. PWAs function even when the device is offline. PWAs make full use of modern web features including push notification, cache, and secure connections to provide rich Web based experiences</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>What is a progressive web app (PWA)</h3>
							<p>A progressive web app (PWA) is the set of mobile web application development techniques that entails building apps that feel and look like native ones. Using a web stack (JS, HTML, and CSS), progressive web apps combine a rich functionality and smooth user experience associated with native apps. Simply put, PWA is the web app with the native-app flavor: After the installation, a user clicks on its icon on a device home screen and gets straight to the website.</p>
							<p>The approach was introduced by Google in 2015, and since then has become a hot topic among engineers thanks to relatively simple development and effective user engagement.</p>
							<h3>The main PWA features and a comparison of them to native apps and web apps</h3>
							<p>PWAs have numerous key features that make them different from traditional web and native apps:</p>
							<p><span>Full responsiveness and browser compatibility.</span> These apps are built according to progressive enhancement principles. Progressive enhancement is the web design strategy of providing the basic functionality and content to everyone regardless of browsers they use or connection quality while delivering more sophisticated page versions to users whose newer browsers can support them.</p>
							<p>So, PWAs work with all browsers and are compatible with any device, regardless of screen size and other specifications. Tablet and mobile users will have the same experience. You can even adjust the app to the desktop if needed.</p>
							<p><span>Connectivity independence.</span>Progressive web applications can work both offline and on low-quality networks.</p>
							<p><span>App-like interface. </span>These apps mimic navigation and interactions of native apps.</p>
							<p><span>Push notifications.</span>If used as a part of a good messaging strategy, push notifications can keep customers interested, motivating them to open and use an app more.</p>
							<p><span>Self-updates. </span>Able to update themselves automatically, apps stay fresh.</p>
							<p><span>Safety. </span>These apps are served through HTTPS, so unauthorized users can’t access their content.</p>
							<p><span>Discoverability and easy installation.</span>While search engines classify PWAs as applications, they are not distributed via app stores. These apps can be shared through a URL instead so they’re easily found. The installation is simple and entails visiting a site and adding it to a device home screen.</p>
							<p>With the PWAs’ significant features in mind, let’s consider additional characteristics to compare these apps with native and standard web apps.</p>
							<h3>The Web App manifest</h3>
							<p>he Web App manifest — a JSON file — is the first component that gives the progressive its native app interface appearance. With the manifest, a developer can control the way the app is displayed to the user (i.e. full-screen mode without visible URL bar) and how it can be launched. The file allows a developer to find a centralized place for the web app’s metadata. The manifest usually contains starting URL, an app’s full and short name, links to icons and icons’ sizes, type, and location. A developer can also define a splash screen and a theme color for the address bar.</p>
							<p>To apply these settings, a developer only has to add a single link to the manifest in all website pages headers.</p>
							<h3>Service Worker</h3>
							<p>A service worker is another technical element that supports one of the main features of progressive web applications — the offline work mode, background syncs, and push notifications typical for native apps. The service worker is a JavaScript file running separately from the web page/app. It responds to user interactions with the app, including network requests made from pages it serves. Because the service worker runs only to process a specific event, its lifetime is short.</p>
							<p><span>Offline work mode.</span>The service worker allows for caching an application shell (interface), so it loads instantly on repeat visits. The necessary dynamic content (i.e. message or payment history, shopping cart, avatars) is refreshed every time the connection is back. These mechanics allows for decent app performance and improved user experience. For example, a messenger user won’t see the difference between the online and offline modes regarding interface: It still works; a message history is available. However, messaging requires connection.</p>
							<p><span>Push notifications.</span>Push notifications are an efficient tool for user re-engagement through the content and prompt updates from websites they like. Progressive web apps can send push notifications even when the browser is closed, and the app isn’t active.</p>
							<p><span>Background synchronization.</span>The service worker is also in charge of this feature. It delays actions until stable connectivity is back. For example, the message sent right before the connection fails will be marked as sent and then will be delivered as soon as service is restored. So, servers can send periodic updates to the app allowing it to update itself when the connection is restored.</p>
